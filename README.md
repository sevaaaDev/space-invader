# Space War

## How to play
h = left
l = right
space = shoot

## purpose of this project
- to learn game architecture
- to learn pixel art
- typescript

## problem i encountered
- how to scale pixel art game
    - because 1x is too small and 2x is too big
- handling input 
    - i use excalibur's keyboard input and htmlbutton event, maybe mixing those makes this complicated
